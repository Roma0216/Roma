# Case Study
Some typical apps from the dataset are selected for the case study. 

## Case 1
The first figure shows the interface of our motivating example "com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook" app.
If we click the green microphone button on the left in the second picture, the VUI starts.
Then we say "hello word" to the app.
After that, as the third figure shows, we click the "," button as the punctuations cannot be easily generated by the VUI.
However, the comma shows on the text box immediately.
A few seconds later, the ASR results returns and "hello word" is appended to the text box as the fourth figure shows.
Finally, the text box shows ",hello word" instead of "hello word,".
The punctuation is expected to appear after the text, but instead before it.

<center class="half">
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page0.png" width = 175 text = "page0"/>
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page1.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page2.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page3.png" width = 175 />
</center>

This app aims to help take notes, but GV-race results in wrong notes.
To correct this result, the user has to delete the comma and retypes it, complicating the original task.



## Case 2
This example shows an app with the VUI implemented by the Google VUI SDK.
If the user accidentally clicks the microphone button, the VUI will be launched (see the first picture).
Before the VUI is launched, the user enters the text "ok" and expects to translate it into Burmese (see the second picture).
Then the VUI launches and records the sound of the news played in the background (see the third picture).
The VUI results (e.g., the content of the news) will be returned and covered the initial input "ok".
Consequently, the final text is the news instead of "ok".

<center class="half">
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page0.png" width = 175 text = "page0"/>
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page1.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page2.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page3.png" width = 175 />
</center>

If the user is a not a native English speaker, he/she might not notice the mistake.
As the text will be translated into Burmese, the users may get wrong translation results.
