# Case Study
Some typical apps from the dataset are selected for the case study. 

## Case 1
The first figure shows the interface of our motivating example "com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook" app.
If we click the green microphone button on the left in the second picture, the VUI starts.
Then we say "hello word" to the app.
After that, as the third figure shows, we click the "," button.
Immediately, the "," text shows on the text box.
Then the ASR process returns and "hello word" is appended to the text box as the fourth figure shows.
Finally, the text box shows ",hello word" instead of "hello word,".
<center class="half">
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page0.png" width = 175 text = "page0"/>
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page1.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page2.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="com.voicenotebook.voicenotebook.apk/page3.png" width = 175 />
</center>

This app serves as a notebook that can take both GUI and VUI notes, but the GV-race makes the notes incorrect.



## Case 2
â€‹The below four figures show the interafaces of the "an.BurmeseTranslate" app.
If we click the microphone button on the top right in the first figure, the VUI starts.
Then, we say "hello" to the app, place the cursor at the beginning of the text box, and tap "g" on the keyboard.
The "g" text shows immediately on the text box as the second figure shows.
In the third figure, a dialog starts to process the VUI input.
In the end, the ASR results returns and "hello" is displayed on the text box.

<center class="half">
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page0.png" width = 175 text = "page0"/>
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page1.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page2.png" width = 175 />
    <img src="an.BurmeseTranslate.apk/page3.png" width = 175 />
</center>
